v0.1b NOTE: CURRENTLY WINDOWS ONLY
A tool for inputting information of a live HotS draft. (BETA)

To use: Grab build from repository in /Builds/ or download the build from here: 
http://www.mediafire.com/file/xvhlybxlcq2oztr/MouseHotSDrafter.zip/file

You must unzip the zip file and run the included executable IF YOU DO NOT UNZIP IT WILL NOT WORK (use WinRAR or 7zip).

CONTROLS: Use mouse for selections, and Esc to exit.

When the program is opened, it will start with a map striker. Simply click on the pictures of maps to ban, and once two are banned the third
map clicked will be the picked map and you'll be allowed to continue to the next screen, which is the Hero draft.
NOTE: Make sure to set whether or not your team was first map pick or first draft pick or the next part won't work correctly!

In the Hero draft, two composition types are currently supported, dive and poke comps. (more planned in future). There are also
filters to display only Heroes of a certain role. Click on the heroes to ban and pick as necessary until your team is decided and 
you're ready to start Game 1!

If a mistake is made during drafting or map selection, there is a reset button which will reset the state to how it was when that
phase first began. Unfortunately, there is no undo button (yet).

Only game 1 of a set is supported.. could still be used for games after by just reseting the draft screen. (ignore the map displayed)

Hope you find some use of this! Send me feedback at my Discord server found here: https://discord.gg/wms7tet or DM me Mouse#2622
